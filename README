Got my STM32F4DISCOVERY board today from digikey.  I didnt know there
was a cortex-m with an fpu so I wanted to try it out.  Cost about $20,
they are giving these things away you might as well get one.

Under the Design support tab you will want to download the users manual

UM1472: STM32F4DISCOVERY STM32F4 high-performance discovery board

It contains the schematic so we can figure out where the leds and other
stuff are on the board.

It uses the STM32F407VGT6 part

You are definitely going to need the reference manual under the Design
Support tab.

RM0090: STM32F405xx, STM32F407xx, STM32F415xx and STM32F417xx advanced
ARM-based 32-bit MCUs

You are also going to want the TRM for the ARM cortex-m4f core

I derived a command line loader from

https://github.com/texane/stlink

which is a gdbserver for the various stm32 stlink boards.  Mine is
limited to this board.  You only need the mini-b usb plugged in to use
the stlink interface, powers the board and communicates with the stlink
interface.

Another way to load is to remove the zero ohm resistor on solder bridge
SB18.  SB18 as shipped shorts boot0 to ground.  With boot0 high
the normal embedded bootloader runs on the stm32f4.  It happens to be a
dfu based usb bootloader.  You will need the micro-b usb connected as
well.  this util works on ubuntu:

http://gitorious.org/~tormod/unofficial-clones/dfuse-dfu-util

Power cycle or reset the microcontroller with boot0 floating wait a
few seconds then

dfu-util -d 0483:df11 -c 1 -i 0 -a 0 -s 0x08000000 -D myprogram.bin

After loading, short boot0 to ground and reset again to run your program
from flash.  Open boot0 and press reset to try again.

If you leave boot0 tied to ground, it is as if SB18 were connected and
you can use the stlink interface.


I decided to separate/isolate the stm32f4 discovery samples from the stm32 value line discovery samples
so now this is in its own repo
