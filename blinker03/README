See the README one level up about where to find the reference manual
for the stm32f4 and schematics for the board.

This is derived from blinker02.  General purpose timer TIM5 is used to
control the blink rate of the led.

The 8MHz external clock HSE is multiplied up to be a 168MHz clock which
is the max clock rate for this chip.

There are a number of rules for the pll, many things have clock speed
limits or range limits.  pllmult.c was used to come up with the main
pll multiplier and divisors.

The flash has a speed limit as does the peripherals so those are reflected
in divisors in the ClockInit() function.

TIM5 is actually a 32 bit counter not 16 like many of the others.  If
we count to 168,000,000 * 4 ticks that should be 4 seconds right?
Well we get 8 seconds per led blink.  I think what is going on is there
are two AHB divisors PPRE1 and PPRE2 with different speed limits.  To
keep PPRE2 at or under 84Mhz it wants a divide by 2, to keep PPRE1 under
42MHz it wants a divide by 4.  The clock tree diagram doesnt really show
these two divisors (that I can see) but it has a thing for the timers
where if divisor is non-zero then multiply by 2.  I assume what this all
means is PPRE1 which is a divide by 4 is multiplied by 2 to feed the
timers.  And that appears to match, if you change PPRE1 to divide by 8
and the it takes 16 seconds for the led to change.

The stm32fdiscovery board users manual has a block diagram for the
chip which shows TIM5 is on the AHB/APB1 side, so that also matches
what we are seeing with PPRE1 affecting the TIM5 counter.
