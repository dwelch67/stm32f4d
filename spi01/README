See the README one level up about where to find the reference manual
for the stm32f4 and schematics for the board.

Trying to figure out how to talk to the LSI302DL on board by bit banging
the spi interface.

a lot closer, I can read two of the three axis, not sure why I cant
read them all.

Careful, I was playing with the built in spi controller, apparently
shorted something out and fried a board.  good thing I bought spares.
